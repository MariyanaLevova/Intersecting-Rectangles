# Intersecting-Rectangles

1. What the program does:

1.1 This program reads data from a JSOn file and creates rectangle objects based on this input. 
1.2 It then checks if any of these rectangles intersect at least once.
1.3 Finally, it checks if multiple intersections exist between rectangles.
1.4 Results are printed to the console. The results include the input rectangles and their intersections.
